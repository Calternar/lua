-- This is a script writed on Luoa! Made by calternar on discord.

-- This script stay on the context of a "SourceBlock" and a "DestinationBlock", teleport is from SB to DB; each block use "ClickDetector", that when you click it, it teleports
-- I will guide you across the short of this code, stay tuned!

local TeleportSource = workspace:FindFirstChild("SourceBlock") -- This is to found dedicated Block, you can modify this as you will to find your block
local TeleportDestination = workspace:FindFirstChild("DestinationBlock") -- This is to found dedicated Block, you can modify this as you will to find your block

local function onTeleportClicked(player, source, destination) -- function
	local character = player.Character -- definition
	if character then
		character:SetPrimaryPartCFrame(destination.CFrame) -- teleport
		print("Teleporting " .. player.Name .. " from " .. source.Name .. " to " .. destination.Name) -- Depuration, this is to register or check the code on your Output
	end
end

local sourceClickDetector = TeleportSource:FindFirstChild("ClickDetector") -- found "ClickDetector" on source block
local destinationClickDetector = TeleportDestination:FindFirstChild("ClickDetector") -- same, for destination block

if sourceClickDetector and destinationClickDetector then
	sourceClickDetector.MouseClick:Connect(function(player)
		onTeleportClicked(player, TeleportSource, TeleportDestination) -- on click, this will teleport you by source code
	end)

	destinationClickDetector.MouseClick:Connect(function(player)
		onTeleportClicked(player, TeleportDestination, TeleportSource) -- same, destination block
	end)
end

-- Thx for reading this short code! Stay tuned for more
